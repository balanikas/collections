TODO:

* Use autofac to setup the Collections library
* use Roslyn as a compiler 
* add links to msdn doc. user must be able to easily go to official doc when mouse over stuff.... or similar
* micromanage the threading/task handling to get more smooth and instant feedback. dont burden the ui thread.
* IMPORTANT: most often code will not be simple, i.e. it will be complex, contain references to other assemblies, etc.
user should be able to select an assembly to work with, when selected, all types are listed in listObjects. dont show code.
* must not be able to compile other than "from folder", or own code
* investigate best practices for async await


Explore
* load assemblies, code files
* see and modify code (when code files are loaded)
* run methods (when params are present and they are supported random arg values are generated for each run)
* instantiate classes
* a param may be supported if that type is provided and can be easily get a random value. for example void Add(MyType x) may work 
with reflection. Reflection the item can be instantiated, but if it is a complex object then it will be hard to generate a random such...
* user can see how long it takes to run something, min, max, avg values, successrate, log of what went wrong, log of random runs.
* pre jit stuff for more correct results
* can own code output to Console? would be nice

* add a "shake" effect on runners, when they have high fail rate.
* present a log over 10 randomly collected successed executions, and 10 failed ones. Maybe make that as a setting value
* make splitter to use accent color
* format the contents of the runners and info flyout (pplacement, etc)
* having that optimization for methods withaout params and return values might be misleading for users.


* if invalid path then tell user

* type selected but no method is selected, annoying
* strange the alog is reused...when switching tabs stuff needs to be closed and resetted!
* in playmode, no animations no nothing...

* app icon for wpfclient



data bind the shit in playviewmodel to canvas....btw why is all so slow??


--- what do i want to be displayed in the play canvs???

* executing type 
* executing method
* avg method execution
* total exec of all iteration
* progress 1-100
* color changing (progress)
* shape size changes (avg method exec time)
* stickprov (return value, param values)




* log error message when loading from invalid path
* does drag n drop work still?





* continue with UTs


* if errors during execution make shape jump around


* in bwrunner, store methodexecutions not in list but in a table...works? why not?
* format exec info decimal points
