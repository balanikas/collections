TODO:
* get correct sizeof ... IMPOSSSIBLE
* use Roslyn as a compiler (problematic?, needs vs2012 stuff)..maybe, its not really ready yet...btw, whats the purpose of that?
* kunna styra exakt vilka actions och hur många ggr
* add links to msdn doc. user must be able to easily go to official doc when mouse over stuff.... or similar
* micromanage the threading/task handling to get more smooth and instant feedback. dont burden the ui thread.
* IMPORTANT: most often code will not be simple, i.e. it will be complex, contain references to other assemblies, etc.
user should be able to select an assembly to work with, when selected, all types are listed in listObjects. dont show code.

* must not be able to compile other than "from folder", or own code
* handle many more cases (static classes, parameter types, etc)

* consider using DLR instead of reflection, for increased performance. At least it  will be fun to implement!

* add support for non generic collections OK


CONCEPT:
* koncept, if game it must be fun.

USE CASES:
* Chris want to find out what are the performance characteristics of each collection, experiment with different methods, objects, etc..is fun for a few minutes at most
* Elaine wants to know how much mem her objects consumes, and perhaps how much 1000 of her objects consume.
* Mike wants to run code and see how the system is affected (cpu,mem)






1. test utility classes
2. test collections performance
3. 



* add samples:
1. different ways to call methods, slowest to fastest
2. boxing/unboxing
3. other (google it)

* 
more stats:
per update
1. minimum time elapsed
2. max time elapsed
3. avg time elapsed


* optimize reflection







--------------------- snow in january ------------------------
4 major things: 
1. Optimize reflection
2. fix GUI, UX, etc
3. What info to be presented..stats?
4. add test cases




* window icon
* min win size?
* modal flyouts?
* add quickcommands for close and show info
* over time add test cases 
* progress bar



typename
methodname
10 samples, each sample has :
execution time 
args value
return value

total executiontime
